# Tab Component

This project demonstrates a simple tab component built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to switch between different tabs to view various sections of content.

## Features

- Tab Navigation: The tab component includes four tabs. Users can click on each tab to navigate between different content sections.
- Dynamic Content Display: When a tab is clicked, the corresponding content is displayed, while the previously active content is hidden.
- Responsive Design: The component is designed to adapt to different screen sizes using media queries in CSS (if added).

## File Structure

- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the tab component.
- style.css: An external CSS file for styling the tab component, including the layout, colors, and responsive behavior.
- index.js: An external JavaScript file to handle the tab-switching logic.

## How It Works

1. HTML: The `index.html` file defines the structure of the tab component. It contains:
   - A container with a section for tab buttons (`.tab_box`) and a section for tab content (`.content_box`).
   - Each tab button is a `button` element with the class `tab_btn`.
   - Each tab content section is a `div` element with the class `content`.

2. CSS: The `style.css` file (not provided here) is used to style the component:
   - The `.active` class highlights the active tab button and displays the active content.
   - The `text-line` element can be styled to add a decorative line under the tabs.
  
3. JavaScript: The `index.js` file (not provided here) is used to implement the tab-switching logic:
   - It listens for clicks on the tab buttons.
   - When a tab button is clicked, the `.active` class is removed from all tabs and content sections.
   - It then adds the `.active` class to the clicked tab button and the corresponding content section, making them visible.

## How to Use

1. Setup: Clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Navigation: Click on the tabs to switch between different content sections.
3. Customization: Modify the content of each tab or the styles in the `style.css` file to fit your needs.

## Example

When the page loads, the first tab and its content are active by default. Clicking on other tabs will display their respective content.

## Future Enhancements

- Add transitions for smoother tab switching.
- Include more complex tab content like forms or interactive elements.
- Implement keyboard navigation for accessibility.
